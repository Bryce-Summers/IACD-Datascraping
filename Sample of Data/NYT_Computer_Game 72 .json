Developed by Todd Hivnor and a team of computer programmers, \"Home Game\" begins with two actors onstage, six more on videotape and an ensemble of acoustic and electrified instruments. These, together with a collection of plot situations and character motivations, provide nutrition for a computer that artfully shuffles the ingredients and produces a story line. Three large screens define the performing space. From one at stage left, the two actors read the bits of narrative as the computer has arranged them. Another screen at stage right provides cues and musical materials for the musicians. These, like the shuddering, repetitive images of video characters on the center screen, have been configured to match the computer's story line. When the computer shuffles again, the same elements produce a somewhat different narrative.","abstract":null,"print_page":"13","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Plots That Rely on Shuffling the Pieces","kicker":"MUSIC REVIEW"},"keywords":[{"name":"creative_works","value":"HOME GAME (PLAY)"},{"name":"subject","value":"REVIEWS"},{"name":"subject","value":"THEATER"}],"pub_date":"1995-06-12T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Cultural Desk","section_name":"Arts; Theater","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Bernard","rank":1,"lastname":"HOLLAND"}],"original":"By BERNARD HOLLAND"},"type_of_material":"Review","_id":"4fd1f1818eb7c8105d747eb7","word_count":433},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2008\/04\/20\/business\/20gret.html","snippet":"A handful of public-minded bankruptcy court judges are exposing the questionable practices of the mortgage servicing business.","lead_paragraph":"A handful of public-minded bankruptcy court judges are exposing the questionable practices of the mortgage servicing business.","abstract":null,"print_page":"1","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Piling On: Borrowers Buried by Fees","kicker":"Fair Game","print_headline":"Piling On: Borrowers Buried by Fees","content_kicker":"Fair Game"},"keywords":[{"value":"Mortgages","is_major":"N","rank":"1","name":"subject"},{"value":"Prices (Fares, Fees and Rates)","is_major":"N","rank":"2","name":"subject"},{"value":"Housing","is_major":"N","rank":"3","name":"subject"},{"value":"Ethics","is_major":"N","rank":"4","name":"subject"},{"value":"Foreclosures","is_major":"N","rank":"5","name":"subject"},{"value":"Morgan, J P, Chase & Co","is_major":"N","rank":"6","name":"organizations"},{"value":"Finances","is_major":"N","rank":"7","name":"subject"}],"pub_date":"2008-04-20T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"SundayBusiness","section_name":"Business Day","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":1,"firstname":"Gretchen","lastname":"MORGENSON"}],"original":"By GRETCHEN MORGENSON"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"5480732338f0d82816288da6","word_count":"1397"},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2011\/12\/07\/technology\/personaltech\/video-games-for-all-tastes-and-attention-spans.html","snippet":"Whether they prefer Angry Birds, FarmVille or Sims Social, it seems that almost everyone plays some kind of electronic game.","lead_paragraph":"Whether they prefer Angry Birds, FarmVille or Sims Social, it seems that almost everyone plays some kind of electronic game.","abstract":"Seth Schiesel Video Game review of some of the top games of the year and game-related accessories.","print_page":"4","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"seo":"Video Games for All Tastes and Attention Spans","main":"Video Games for All Tastes and Attention Spans","print_headline":"Video Games for All Tastes and Attention Spans","content_kicker":"Video Game Review"},"keywords":[{"rank":"1","is_major":"Y","value":"Computer and Video Games","name":"subject"},{"rank":"2","is_major":"N","value":"Wii (Video Game System)","name":"subject"},{"rank":"3","is_major":"N","value":"Xbox 360 (Video Game System)","name":"subject"},{"rank":"4","is_major":"N","value":"PlayStation 3 (Video Game System)","name":"subject"},{"rank":"5","is_major":"N","value":"Sony Corporation","name":"organizations"},{"rank":"6","is_major":"N","value":"Nintendo Co Ltd","name":"organizations"}],"pub_date":"2011-12-07T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Business","section_name":"Technology","subsection_name":"Personal Tech","byline":{"contributor":"","person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Seth","rank":1,"lastname":"SCHIESEL"}],"original":"By SETH SCHIESEL"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"5403e72338f0d80e250f45ad","word_count":"2409"},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2000\/11\/06\/theater\/theater-review-although-it-s-a-show-this-game-is-for-real.html","snippet":"So, who doesn't want to be a millionaire?

The folks behind the cameras, including the one with the question cards, are just as greedy as the rest of us, and the real question asked in ''Game Show,'' a spunky spoof of America's perennially popular television fare by Jeffrey Finn and Bob Walton, is just how far they are willing to go to claw their way to the top of the network pyramid. In fact, ''Game Show'' is a sort of cross between a traditional quiz program and ''Survivor'' in which the last man or woman standing after a no-holds-barred brawl of television politics takes all. With the double-crossing, back-stabbing power struggles shuffled in with an actual trivia-quiz program in which contestants drawn from the audience play for real prizes, ''Game Show'' is not only a funny comedy but also lots of fun.","abstract":"Wilborn Hampton reviews Jeffrey Finn and Bob Walton play Game Show, directed by Mark Waldrop; photo (M)","print_page":"5","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Although It's a Show, This Game Is For Real","kicker":"THEATER REVIEW"},"keywords":[{"name":"creative_works","value":"GAME SHOW (PLAY)"},{"name":"persons","value":"WALTON, BOB"},{"name":"persons","value":"WALDROP, MARK"},{"name":"persons","value":"FINN, JEFFREY"},{"name":"subject","value":"REVIEWS"},{"name":"subject","value":"THEATER"}],"pub_date":"2000-11-06T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"The Arts\/Cultural Desk","section_name":"Arts; Theater","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Wilborn","rank":1,"lastname":"HAMPTON"}],"original":"By WILBORN HAMPTON"},"type_of_material":"Review","_id":"4fd23df48eb7c8105d7d4173","word_count":894},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/1999\/09\/09\/technology\/library-sites-for-computer-geeks-where-the-help-desk-goes-for-good-advice-408956.html","snippet":"MAC OBSERVER  www.macobserver.com       FOR Macintosh addicts, one of the most energetic geek sites on the Web is the Mac Observer, which is updated several times a day.
